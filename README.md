Using Coursera ML tools on Kaggle Titanic challenge

This is taking the Titanic challenge and using tools just learned in the Andrew Ng Coursera Machine Learning course offered by Stanford.  No EDA.  

I used two algorithms:
* Support Vector Machine - score: 0.78947
* Neural Network - single layer not adequate: 38% accuracy on training set

The code is straight off the course, the adaptation to the challenge is mine.

Note: IÕve made no attempt to clean this up.  The intent is to start getting a GitHub presence.
