Using Coursera ML tools on Kaggle Titanic challenge

This is taking the Titanic challenge and using tools just learned in the Andrew Ng Coursera Machine Learning course offered by Stanford.  I used two algorithms:
* Support Vector Machine
* Neural Network

The code is straight off the course, the adaptation to the challenge is mine.

Note: IÕve made no attempt to clean this up.  The intent is to start getting a GitHub presence.
